## Abstract
Plastic pollution is an enormous global environmental and health concern. Environmentally-leaching endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) such as bisphenol A (BPA) have been well-documented. However, an integrative perspective of the extent, magnitude, and variation of the effects of BPA on aquatic organisms is incomplete. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the effects of BPA exposure (concentration and duration) on various functional traits (e.g. reproductive, behaviour, development), and across different biological scales (macromolecule to organism response) of aquatic organisms. Con-currently, we used a systematic method to review our current understanding and BPA and to provide future directions for EDC research. We show thatâ€¦
