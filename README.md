## Abstract
Plastic pollution is a global environmental and health concern. The endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) bisphenol A (BPA) is nearly ubiquitous in aquatic environments, and it continues to be produced and released into the environment in large quantities. BPA disrupts hormone signalling across a broad range of taxa and can thereby have far-reaching physiological and ecological consequences on a global scale. However, the nature, magnitude, and variation of the effects of BPA on aquatic organisms is not clear. Hence, the aim of this study was to establish the current state-of-knowledge of the effect of BPA on biological functions in aquatic systems. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the effects of BPA exposure on functional traits (e.g. reproductive, behaviour, development), and across different biological levels of aquatic organisms. Overall, we show that BPA exposure negatively affected aquatic organisms, with the abnormality, behavioural, cardiovascular, developmental, growth, survival, and plant-specific traits significantly decreased from BPA exposure. We also show that the embryonic, larval and juvenile stage were the most sensitive to BPA exposure, and BPA exposure is taxon-specific. The variations and context-dependant nature of responses to BPA provides important implications for the management efforts and research directions of EDCâ€™s on aquatic organisms.
